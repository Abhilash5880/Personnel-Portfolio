## ‚ú® Features

* **Engaging Landing Page:** A full-screen hero section with an immersive background GIF/video to introduce the user.
* **Smooth Transition:** A seamless, animated transition from the landing page to the main content area for a polished user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout intelligently adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    * On larger screens, the landing page features a split layout with the visual content on the left and introductory text/call-to-action on the right.
    * On smaller screens, elements gracefully stack, with content and the call-to-action button aligned to the right for mobile-first readability.
* **Interactive Art Gallery:** A dedicated section to display digital artworks, designed with a dynamic grid layout (aiming for a Masonry-like effect) that makes Browse visually appealing.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** Focus on a minimalist aesthetic with clear navigation and an intuitive user interface.
* **Built with Standard Web Technologies:** Developed using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, ensuring broad compatibility and performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design (including Flexbox and Grid).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For interactive elements, landing page transitions, and dynamic gallery item sizing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

* **Gallery Grid Masonry Effect:** The JavaScript for calculating `grid-row-end` for the Masonry-like layout can sometimes result in `NaN` errors in the console, leading to inconsistent item sizing and spacing. This is an area for further refinement and debugging.
* **Image Loading Errors:** Ensure all image paths are correct to avoid `404 (Not Found)` errors for gallery items and other assets.
* **Fine Tuning for different screen size:** Used CSS media queries to change sizes and alignment to make the website look good on all screen sizes
* **Accessibility:** Further enhancements can be made to improve accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
* **Performance Optimization:** Implementing more advanced image/videos, video player, smoother loading and considering minifying CSS/JS for production.
